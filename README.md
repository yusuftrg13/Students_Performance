Student Performance Prediction Model
This repository contains code for a Multiple Linear Regression model used to predict the performance of students based on various factors like hours studied, previous scores, sleep hours, and extracurricular activities. The dataset and code are designed to help understand the relationships between these factors and a student's performance index.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Hours Studied: Hours the student studied in a day.
Previous Scores: The student’s previous scores.
Extracurricular Activities: Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes/No).
Sleep Hours: Average sleep hours per day.
Sample Question Papers Practiced: Number of practice papers solved.
Performance Index: The target variable representing the student’s performance score.
